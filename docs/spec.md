## 1. Software System

_This section describers the entire software system. This includes the users of the system, as well as all the applications, databases, and APIs the system is made of. The application that we're building (the customer-facing web app) is a part of this system._

### System Context

_This is a zoomed out view of the system and the context around it. The system context diagram below follows the guidelines of the C4 Model for visualizing software architecture._

#### System Users

- **Customer** ‚Äî .
- **Trainer** ‚Äî .
- **Gym** ‚Äî .

#### External Systems

### System Containers

_These are the building blocks of the system. Use this list as well as the system context diagram above to build the container diagram for the software system._

- **User Web App** ‚Äî This is the app that we're designing the architecture for. It's a web application used by users to keep tracking of their trainings.
- **Core API** [Next.js] ‚Äî REST API used by all mobile and web apps within the system. The Core API also acts as a gateway to external systems (i.e. third-party payment and admin systems.)
- **Core Database** [MongoDB] ‚Äî Main data store for the application. The Core API reads from and writes to this database.
